# **IntCens**

Interval-censored data arise when the failure time of each study subject is only known to lie in an interval. IntCens is a stand-alone executable (written in C++) that implements nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE) for a broad class of semiparametric regression models with general interval-censored data. The current release handles three types of failure time data:

-   Univariate. Univariate failure time data described in Zeng, Mao and Lin (2016).

-   Multiple Event. Failure times for multiple types of events.

-   Clustered. Subjects are clustered, e.g. by family.
